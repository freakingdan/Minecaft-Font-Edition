# Minecraft: Font Edition

Turns your Geometry Dash into some blocky world (kinda) of Minecraft

Partner it with Alphalaneous' [Minecraftify!](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/zalphalaneous.minecraft) mod for the full experience.

This is the second installment of my font pack that i have to steal from someone's mods but i will credit it here anyways for your convenience.

# Credits:

This font pack would like to thanks:
* **Alphalaneous** for the Minecraftify mod
* **RayDeeUx** for the [ChangeFont19](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/alphalaneous_raydeeux.changefont19) which inspired me to make this font pack!
* **Mojang** for making Minecraft and this iconic font
